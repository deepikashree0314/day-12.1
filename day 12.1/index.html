            <h4>THE NATIONAL POET OF BANGLADESHJ</h4>

                    <h4>Rebel Poet</h4>
                    <div>Nazrul left the army in 1920 and settled in Kolkata, which was then the Cultural capital of India (it had ceased to be the political capital in 1911). He joined the staff of the “Bangiya Mussalman Sahitya Samiti” ("Bengali Muslim Literary Society") and roomed at 32 College Street with colleagues. He published his first novel Bandhan-hara (Freedom from bondage) in 1920, which he kept working on over the next seven years. His first collection of poems included "Bodhan,” "Shat-il-Arab," "Kheya-parer Tarani" and "Badal Prater Sharab." Both works received critical acclaim, giving the young poet his first taste of fame.[2]

                        Working at the literary society, Nazrul grew close to a rising generation of Muslim writers including Mohammad Mozammel Haq, Afzalul Haq, Kazi Abdul Wadud and Muhammad Shahidullah. He was a regular at clubs for Calcutta's writers, poets and intellectuals like the Gajendar Adda and the Bharatiya Adda. In October 1921, Nazrul went to Santiniketan with Muhammad Shahidullah and met Rabindranath Tagore. Despite many differences, Nazrul looked to Tagore as a mentor and the two remained in close association.[2] In 1921, Nazrul was engaged to be married to Nargis, the niece of a well-known Muslim publisher Ali Akbar Khan, in Daulatpur, Comilla District. But on June 18, 1921 — the day of the wedding — the plans fell through. Upon public insistence by Ali Akbar Khan that the terms of the marriage contract be altered to include a requirement that Nazrul must reside in Daulatpur after wedding, Nazrul walked away from the ceremony. [3]
                        
                        Nazrul catapulted to fame with the publication of "Bidrohi" in 1922, which remains his most famous work. At the time of publication, no other poem since Tagore's "Shonar tori" had met with such spontaneous acclaim and criticism for its radical approach. Set in a heroic meter, this long poem invokes images from Hindu, Muslim and Greek mythology.[2] Nazrul won admiration of India's literary classes by his description of the rebel whose impact is fierce and ruthless even as its spirit is deep:
                        
                        I am the unutterable grief,
                        I am the trembling first touch of the virgin,
                        I am the throbbing tenderness of her first stolen kiss.
                        I am the fleeting glace of the veiled beloved,
                        I am her constant surreptitious gaze.
                        
                        I am the burning volcano in the bosom of the earth,
                        I am the wild fire of the woods,
                        I am Hell's mad terrific sea of wrath!
                        I ride on the wings of the lightning with joy and profound,
                        I scatter misery and fear all around,
                        I bring earth-quakes on this world!
                        
                        I am the rebel eternal,
                        I raise my head beyond this world,
                        High, ever erect and alone![4]
                        
                        Published in the "Bijli" magazine, the poem caused a popular sensation. Nazrul stormed into Tagore's residence, jokingly declaring "Gurudev, I have come to kill you off." The rebellious language and theme found resonance with public consciousness of the time, which correlated with the Non-cooperation movement — the first, mass nationalist campaign of civil disobedience against British rule.[2][5] Nazrul explores a synthesis of different forces in a rebel, destroyer and preserver, expressing rage as well as beauty and sensitivity. Nazrul followed up by writing "Pralayollas" ("Destructive Euphoria"), and his first anthology of poems, the "Agniveena" ("Lyre of Fire") in 1922, which enjoyed astounding and far-reaching success. He also published his first volume of short stories, the "Byather Dan" ("Gift of Sorrow") and "Yugbani,” an anthology of essays</div><br>

                        With his wife and young son Bulbul, Nazrul settled in Krishnanagar in 1926. 
                        His work began to transform as he wrote poetry and songs that articulated the aspirations of the downtrodden masses. Nazrul assailed the socio-economic norms and political system that had brought upon misery. The songs of Nazrul giving voice to the aspirations of the masses have come to known as "mass music." His major poems include "Daridro" ("Poverty"):O poverty, thou hast made me great.
Thou hast made me honoured like Christ
With his crown of thorns. Thou hast given me
Courage to reveal all. To thee I owe
My insolent, naked eyes and sharp tongue.
Thy curse has turned my violin to a sword...
O proud saint, thy terrible fire
Has rendered my heaven barren.
O my child, my darling one
I could not give thee even a drop of milk
No right have I to rejoice.
Poverty weeps within my doors forever
As my spouse and my child.
Who will play the flute?[8]

In what his contemporaries regarded as one of his greatest flairs of creativity, Nazrul began composing the very first ghazals in Bengali, transforming a form of poetry written mainly in Persian and Urdu. While hailed by many as a pioneer and epoch-making poet by progressives, who took inspiration from his works that attacked traditions and dogma on behalf of the masses, he was also derided by many as an irreligious influence on society. Arousing controversy and passions in his readers, Nazrul's ideas attained great popularity across India. In 1928, Nazrul began working as a lyricist, composer and music director for His Master's Voice Gramophone Company. The songs written and music composed by him were broadcast on radio stations across the country. He was also recruited by the Indian Broadcasting Company.

Nazrul professed faith in the absolute equality of women — a view his contemporaries considered revolutionary. In his poem "Naree" ("Women"), Nazrul repudiates what he sees as the long-standing oppression of women, proclaiming their equality:

Whatever great or benevolent achievements
That are in this world
Half of that was by woman
The other half by man.[9]

However, most of his descriptions of women do not extend beyond domestic roles.[10] His poetry retains long-standing notions of men and women in binary opposition to one another and does not affirm gender similarities and flexibility in the social structure:

Man has brought the burning, scorching heat of the sunny day;
Woman has brought peaceful night, soothing breeze and cloud.
Man comes with desert-thirst; woman provides the drink of honey.
Man ploughs the fertile land; woman sows crops in it turning it green.
Man ploughs, woman waters; that earth and water mixed together, brings about a harvest of golden paddy.[10]

However, Nazrul's poems strongly emphasize the confluence of the roles of both sexes and their equal importance to life. He stunned society with his poem "Barangana" ("Prostitute"), in which he addresses a prostitute as "mother." Nazrul expresses no hesitation in accepting the prostitute as a human being. Reasoning that this person was breast-fed by a noble woman and belonging to the race of "mothers and sisters," he assails society's notions of prostitutes as impure and ignoble persons. However, Nazrul's emphasis does not exceed the basic roles of women in society. Nazrul explores a woman's feelings in one of his most popular songs, "Mour Ghumghore Key Elay Monohour" ("Who is the beauty that traverses my dream?"), at her separation from her husband. While vivid in his account of the woman's torment, Nazrul has been criticized in modern times for not exploring the possibility that a woman's life may reach beyond wifely duties. Nazrul elucidates the feelings of an "ideal woman," devoted to her husband and explores the imagination of men in their idealization of woman.[10]

Nazrul's songs are commonly called as Nazrul geeti, which is still practiced as one of the most popular variety of songs in Bengali, like Rabindra Sangeet (songs of Rabindranath Tagore).
